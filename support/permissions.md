# Permissions

On a typical Linux system, the `nobody` user has very limited permissions and is generally not able to perform actions that require elevated privileges. Here's a breakdown of what the `nobody` user can and cannot do regarding the tasks you've mentioned:

## 1\. Binding to Port 8080

By default, **the `nobody` user cannot bind to privileged ports** (ports below 1024). However, port **8080 is not a privileged port**, so technically, the `nobody` user **should be able to bind to port 8080**.

That said, whether the `nobody` user can bind to port 8080 depends on a few conditions:

-   The server must have permissions to bind to that port.
-   No other service should already be using port 8080.

If you encounter permission issues even for port 8080, you might need to adjust the capabilities of the binary or use a different user.

## 2\. Running the `mount` Command

The **`mount` command typically requires superuser (root) privileges** because it deals with the kernel and filesystem mount points. As such, the `nobody` user **cannot run `mount`** to perform mount or unmount operations or even read its configurations if elevated permissions are needed.

However, if you only need to **read the output of the `mount` command** (like in your Go application), it doesn't require elevated privileges because it's just reading from the system's mounted devices and is allowed to do so by default.

## Solutions

1.  **For Binding to Port 8080**:

    -   The `nobody` user should be able to bind to port 8080 since it's not a privileged port. If you face any issues, you can check for any firewall rules or port usage conflicts.
    -   Alternatively, you can consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache that runs with higher privileges and forwards requests to your application running under the `nobody` user.
2.  **For Running the `mount` Command**:

    -   If you only need to read the output of `mount`, no special permissions are required beyond what the `nobody` user already has.
    -   If more advanced mount operations are required, you'd need to run your Go application as a user with the necessary privileges (not `nobody`), or use `sudo` and configure the system to allow specific operations for your application without a password (using `sudoers`).

## Conclusion

For your Go application:

-   **Binding to port 8080** should be fine for the `nobody` user.
-   **Running the `mount` command** to read its output is also fine for the `nobody` user, but performing mount operations is not.

If you encounter specific permission issues, consider using a different user with slightly more privileges, or adjust the system's settings to permit the necessary actions while maintaining security.
